Volume 1 The Assassin's Road
By Kazuo Koike & Goseki Kojima

Lone Wolf and Cub(Kozure Okami in Japan) 
is acknowledged worldwide for the brillant 
writing of the series creator Kazuo Koike and
the groundbreaking cinematic visuals 
of the late Goseki Kojima. Creating 
unforgettable imagery of stark beaty, 
kinetic fury, and visceral thematic power,
the epic samuray adventure has influenced 
a generation of visual storytellers both in 
Japan and in the West.

"It takes you to another time, and to a
frightening, alien land, windswept and gray.
Koike and Kojima tell their story masterfully
and artfully, portraying a man, a boy, and a
country on their journey into Hell."

-Frank Miller.

-Your promised five hundred Ryõ. Please count it.

-Sugito Kenmotsu, the Kuni-Karó elder of our Mibu Han, is guarded
by five masters of the Nenryü sword school, the guardian eight of Mibu.
My comrades in the Han who have tried to assassinate sugito have all been stopped by the guardian eight, and none are left alive.

-Our lord and Daimyô Noriyuki is ailing. Sugito schemes to force him to retire, and to place the young master Takemaru, scion of another branch of the clan, in the castle in his place. Takemaru is but a child; Sugito will control him, and the han, like a puppet.

-I beg of you. Use your sword to rid our lord of these jackals at his side.

-I shall enter the Shima.

-What the hell is that?

-Flying a damn flag he is.

-Looks like a samurai, but he's got a kid.

-Fuck, he's just some starving tramp rônin.

-Like, his wife runs off with an Ashigaru, see? Cuckolds him. Wiggles her Butt in his face and leaves him with the little Brat.

-What the fuck's that? Son for Hire, sword for Hire? Suiô school, Ittô ôgami?

-Itto ôgami? Ôkami, like in wolf? One-sword wolf?

GARA GARA

-Naw, Ya dope. It's Ôgami. A samurai name. 

-I undertand about the sword, but what's this son stuff?

-Look at 'im. Cute little tyke.

-The heishi byway through the Nikkô mountains, near the town of Imaichi...

-*Assassin Dispatched from Edo. Name, unknown. Age, unknown. Sword school, weapons, all unknown. Have confirmed that he travels with small child. From this he is often called...

-"Lone wolf and cub, he is said to be highly dangerous. Take immediate precautions... I see..."

-An assassin with a child.

-HEH HEH HEH...
He thought that would throw us off, but now that we've broken his disguise, he's trapped.

[Page 10]
-Having a kid along will shackle him, hand and foot... lone wolf and cub?! Don't make me laugh!

-If we can take him prisoner as our lord elder Sugito commands, and force him to name his employer, we'll have unshakeable evidence against the edo-elder.

-We just say edo sent him to assassinate young lord Takemaru.

-Mibu's thirty thousand Koku will be in the palm of our lord elder's hand. Heh heh heh...

-Gensa and his men should be springing the trap right now...

-indeed...

-Is that your child sir?

-He is.

Hoh...

[Page 12]
-Something you want?

-I have a boy the same age as yours. Haven't seen him for ages... will you let me just hold him for a minute to easy my heart on this journey? 
Of course, I'll pay handsomely.

-My sign doesn't lie. But the boy says he doesn't like you.

-What?!

-He says you smell of murder... children are pure at heart. They pick up on things like that.

GRN!

-I see you recognized the Nenryü school hawk-wing eye attack, and managed to protect your son's eyes in time impressive...

-And your agility in leaping from that runaway cart, also most praiseworthy. But now, it's over.

[Page 20]
-RNNG!

CHAK!

-Desist! What can you without your eyesight?

-Those eyes of yours won't open again for hours.

-You-you bastards! Who are you? Why did you attack us?

-Heh heh heh... I should think you would know that better than anyone... you, the assassin.

-....

-Drop your Dötnanúki and come with us.

-Drop it!

-Hah hah hah...
The young lord must be bored, playing the same games day after day. The castle Honmaru is much more spacious, and your attendants there will play with you whenever you command.

-Yes, that day will come. This whole castle will be yours, young lord.

-And your ald unkie's too. Hah hah...

-Tidings, my lord.

-Speak!

-The assassin of which we heard from Edo. He's...

-What is it?!

-I see you got him. Good work!

[Page 23]
-Hoh! So this is our man.

-How about it, fellow. Tell us all you know, and we'll let you live. We treat our witnesses well.

-Think of your cute child.

-Speak! Who hired you? 

-Spit it out! What's the name of the man who hired you, assassin?

-It's about time for pee.

-W-what?!

[Page 24]
-I mean my boy. Would someone take him to the toilet? I don't want him fouling the garden.

-Forget that!

-Let him pee! Now speak!

-I can't get it off my mind. Wouldn't want him to get used to peeing his pants.

-Daigoro.

-Do you need to pee?

-...

UUUNG... WAHHHH!!

-Confound it! Stop that crying!

-There, there...

-GYAHHHHN!

-Damn it! Shut up already!

-He won't let anyone else help him. Once he's peed...

-I'll tell you everything. 

-All right! Let him go.

[Page 25]
-Be quick about it!

-Pee-pee, Daigoro. Pee-Pee.

-There. That's done.

-And so, tell me.

-How did you know I was an assassin?

-We have our spies throughout Edo. One sent us a warning by runner.

-"Assassin dispatched from Edo. Name, unknown. Age, unknown. Sword school, weapons, all unknown.

-"Have confirmed that he travels with small child.

-"From this he is often called... lone wolf and cub..."

-The devil!

-How did you know that?!

[Page 26]
-Because I wrote it!

-After I killed your spy in Edo!
